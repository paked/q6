# q6

a programming language testing sandbox for creative code.

Current ideas:

1. semantic code editing
2. time travel debugging
3. intelligent if-statements

## semantic code editing

Part of the reason Scratch seems to work as an environment for teaching novice programmers how to code is that it utilises a block-based drag-and-drop interface to minimise cognitive load. Could a similar abstraction be created which operates on top of the "raw text" model, instead of replacing it entirely? Would this make it more appetising to people who want to learn a "real" programming language (ignoring if this sentiment is useful or not)?

Goals:

1. discoverability of funcionality
2. make it clearer what

### features

- structural expansion: things like function declarations, if statements, while statements, assignments, and for loops are structurally represented in the interface (ie. you don't have to do any formatting). 
- command palette
